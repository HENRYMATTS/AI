# AI
A deep neural network (DQN) controlled AI agent learns to navigate the frozen lake environment.
This environment was implemented using pygame a python graphics library. It was inspired by frozen lake environment in the OpenAi's gym library. A library that provides various environments for Reinforcenment Learning.
The Agent (blue square) moves from the starting point (brown square) traverses the environment looking for the best path to reach the goal (red square) while avoiding falling into holes (black square)



I have included 2 model weights from my training sessions 
Once the training loop is complete, the weights are stored in the Trained_models folder in this format model_1000.
The name of the weights has a No. that indicates the number of Epochs or for how long the model trained.
The greater the training cycles/Epochs the better the model performs


The python script named human is the format of the game that can be played by a human controller with arrow keys
